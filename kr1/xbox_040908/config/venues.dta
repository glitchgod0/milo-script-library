; Venue names must be all lower-case, and must not contain spaces or
; symbols.

; For now, crowd_area points should be in either clockwise or
; counter-clockwise order.

; NOTE!  stage_chars does not exactly specify which characters will be present.
; It specifies what outfit (archetype + material set) to use for that
; stage character in this venue, *if* the song calls for the stage
; character.  NOTE ALSO that it can be used to inhibit certain characters.
; For instance in the dive bar, we want 2 band members, but if it's a
; hip-hop band, then we don't want any dancers, just the DJ.  So, we'd
; omit dancers from this list.
;
; format:
; (stage_chars
;    (<name> <archetype> <mat_set>)
; <name> refers to what the character is called in the song's configuration.
