btm_sub_fail_chapter_1_010,After a disappointing performance the band made the painful decision to call it quits, devastating their loyal fans.,,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_1_020,"I just don't get why they couldn't even...",,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_1_030,"It's a damn shame. I just hope they're hiring down at the poop factory. Awful work, but the hours are flexible.",,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_1_040,Although the band's career ended tragically soon, their rock and roll legacy would live on.,,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_1_050,"Wait, who are we talking about? I don't think I've ever heard of them.",,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_1_060,"What were they, like, a reggae band? Ska band?",,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_1_070,Gone but not forgotten, perhaps the band could try again and make more realistic wagers next time. Ahem.,,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_1_080,That's next on Beneath the Tuneage.,,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_2a_010,Despite their obvious star potential, the band's rock and roll bet hadn't paid out and the band made the tough decision to disband.,,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_2a_020,"I mean, it was a hard call. I don't know what I would have done in their shoes.",,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_2a_030,"Everybody saw that coming. The writing was on the wall. If you didn't know that was happening, you weren't paying attention.",,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_2a_040,Their influential label was also dissolved.,,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_2a_050,"I wonder whatever happened to the Crummy Nummers. Those girls were really great.",,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_2a_060,"It was a rock and roll tragedy.",,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_2a_070,Though they didn't last long, like an uncapped marker on a sectional couch, the band made an indelible impression on the music world.,,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_2a_080,Thanks for watching.,,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_2b_010,Although Global Mogul Records had invested heavily into the band, no amount of money could recover the band's reputation and the band was dropped from the label.,,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_2b_020,"To go from up here to down there that fast? Man, that's rough.",,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_2b_030,Even after a few dedicated years of trying to make it on their own, the band was never able to find mainstream success and eventually faded into obscurity.,,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_2b_040,"We were really devastated by their breakup.",,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_2b_050,"It was just a real bummer.",,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_2b_060,Though the band's career was short-lived, their legacy would live on, perhaps in new and unexpected ways.,,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_2b_070,Tune in next time on Beneath the Tuneage.,,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_3a_010,The band left the venue that night unaware that they had just performed their final show.,,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_3a_020,"They were always a bad luck band. They just, for the life of them they could just not catch a break.",,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_3a_030,"Yeah, that's just always the tragic thing, right?",,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_3a_040,Though they tried with all their might, the band was unable to recover from the string of bad performances, and bad luck, that had dogged them.,,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_3a_050,"Yeah, when they broke up we were all like, 'Yeah. Of course.'",,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_3a_060,"They broke up way too early. They had so much talent. Such a waste.",,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_3a_070,Despite their auspicious formation and early days, the band's breakup left a trail of broken dreams in the wake of their broken-down tour bus.,,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_3a_080,But could their engine rev once more? That's next on Beneath the Tuneage.,,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_3b_010,Though the band had made it through many trials and tribulations, they just couldn't survive in the wake of their final performance.,,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_3b_020,"To go through what they went through and to end like that...it's just awful.",,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_3b_030,"They were so close to turning it around.",,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_3b_040,After the singer's on-stage meltdown, the bassist unceremoniously parted ways with the band.,,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_3b_050,Their guitarist decided to get a teaching degree while the drummer just kind of chilled on the couch a lot.,,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_3b_060,"You don't want to see your favorite band go out like that. You just don't.",,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_3b_070,Despite a stormy career, the band had a typhoon of an impact on music history.,,,
btm_sub_fail_chapter_3b_080,Could their tornado of hope have a second wind? Next time, on Beneath the Tuneage.,,,
btm_sub_finale_bronze_010,After a long, bumpy ride on the rock and roll roller coaster, the band unanimously decided to retire from the limelight at the height of their fame.,,,
btm_sub_finale_bronze_020,"I mean, they had a really tough run. Nobody faulted them for it.",,,
btm_sub_finale_bronze_030,"You would either get the worst show you've ever seen or the greatest show you've ever seen.",,,
btm_sub_finale_bronze_040,The singer found financial security as a contestant on the popular reality show Has-Beens, in which former celebrities cohabitate and try to create cool new catchphrases.,,,
btm_sub_finale_bronze_050,The singer's best effort, "This gumball tastes nasty," has yet to catch on.,,,
btm_sub_finale_bronze_060,Disillusioned with the music industry, the bassist returned to the band's hometown, working up the ranks to become foreperson at the poop factory on Sixth Street.,,,
btm_sub_finale_bronze_070,Following a very public breakdown, the drummer went missing.,,,
btm_sub_finale_bronze_080,Reports of a person matching the drummer's description, a person who lives in a remote Ontario village and spends the days ice fishing and insulting innocent passersby, remain unsubstantiated.,,,
btm_sub_finale_bronze_090,And after marrying and then divorcing a celebrity plastic surgeon, the guitarist relocated to Clearwater, Florida, opening an unsuccessful budget steakhouse called Licks and Chops.,,,
btm_sub_finale_bronze_100,Though the band itself was no more, their memory would live on.,,,
btm_sub_finale_bronze_110,"Yeah, there's always those dark times, but...",,,
btm_sub_finale_bronze_120,"The dark times just kind of have dissipated and worked their way into obscurity, I guess.",,,
btm_sub_finale_bronze_130,Despite a career filled with more ups and downs than a coffee shop toilet seat, the band persevered, and their music provided the soundtrack for a generation.,,,
btm_sub_finale_gold_010,Webster's Dictionary defines "band" as "a flat, thin strip or loop of material put around something.",,,
btm_sub_finale_gold_020,But this band became so much more.,,,
btm_sub_finale_gold_030,"They took something that was so incredibly difficult and made it sound so incredibly simple and flawless.",,,
btm_sub_finale_gold_040,"They, like, renewed my hope in rock and roll.",,,
btm_sub_finale_gold_050,Through all the triumph and all the heartache, the band stuck together through thick and thin, becoming the world's most famous rock and roll outfit.,,,
btm_sub_finale_gold_060,"I can't think of any musician that I know of that hasn't been heavily influenced by their work.",,,
btm_sub_finale_gold_070,"They set the bar high, and the rest is history.",,,
btm_sub_finale_gold_080,Always drawn to the spotlight, the singer became "the mean judge" on a popular singing competition TV show, and capitalized on that notoriety to become a powerful spokesperson against the heinous Free Whale Meat for Prisoners program.,,,
btm_sub_finale_gold_090,Known to the band as a true diplomat, the bassist permanently emigrated to Gurdzblechistan, and was promptly elected President and Eternal Bringer of the Funky Basslines, which, oddly, was already the official presidential title.,,,
btm_sub_finale_gold_100,A true master of the skins, the drummer was inducted into the Drummer Hall of Fame, which was totally a thing, in Schenectady, New York, and became permanent tabloid fodder thanks to a seemingly endless string of romances with high-profile underpants models.,,,
btm_sub_finale_gold_110,And the guitarist continues to tour worldwide, offering free guitar lessons to inner city youth and penning the highly successful memoir "Badder Than You Wants Me to Be: A Shredder's Tale of Life on the Road.",,,
btm_sub_finale_gold_120,They gambled on rock and roll, and they won big, earning nearly unanimous critical acclaim.,,,
btm_sub_finale_gold_130,"The first time I saw them I was just like, 'They get it!'",,,
btm_sub_finale_gold_140,Legends in their own time, plus several other times after that, the band truly defined what it means to be rock stars.,,,
btm_sub_finale_silver_010,After an epic drive along the pothole-pockmarked highway of rock and roll, the members of the band decided to part ways and pursue their individual dreams.,,,
btm_sub_finale_silver_020,"Everybody dreams of going out on top, but almost nobody gets to do it.",,,
btm_sub_finale_silver_030,"You'd see them and you'd be like, 'Oh my God, this is so awesome. Why did this stop?'",,,
btm_sub_finale_silver_040,"But it almost had to stop because it was so good it only had a certain time to live.",,,
btm_sub_finale_silver_050,Famous for having both killer pipes and a real steamy bod, the singer amassed an impressive fortune after creating a line of hard-rocking aerobics DVDs called Rockin' Bottoms.,,,
btm_sub_finale_silver_060,Ever the consummate musician, the bassist pursued a solo career and became the first successful solo bass player in the history of music.,,,
btm_sub_finale_silver_070,The drummer opened a moderately successful chain of family-friendly barbecue restaurants called Piggy Belly Chub Tubs throughout the American Midwest.,,,
btm_sub_finale_silver_080,And the guitarist, always known for a philanthropic streak, became an internationally beloved humanitarian after founding a charity to benefit hunky firefighters in need of minor back surgery.,,,
btm_sub_finale_silver_090,"You may not understand, but you gotta respect their choices.",,,
btm_sub_finale_silver_100,From high school rabble-rousers to radical rock revolutionaries, the band had woven a truly epic yarn.,,,
btm_sub_finale_silver_110,And through the highs and the lows, the stresses and struggles, and about 4,300 gas station burritos, that yarn could never unravel.,,,
btm_sub_mode_intro_010,Next, on Beneath the Tuneage.,,,
btm_sub_mode_intro_020,They started as friends bound together by a rock and roll dream.,,,
btm_sub_mode_intro_030,"Lights go down...",,,
btm_sub_mode_intro_040,"They were just untouchable live.",,,
btm_sub_mode_intro_050,"You hear this hum...",,,
btm_sub_mode_intro_060,"They were so intense and no one was that heavy back then.",,,
btm_sub_mode_intro_070,Talented, great-looking, and chock full of charisma, the band was a tall glass of rock water served on the rocks.,,,
btm_sub_mode_intro_080,"It was like, 'chug chug, chug chug, chug chug.'",,,
btm_sub_mode_intro_090,"Oh my God, their shows were so intense.",,,
btm_sub_mode_intro_100,"'Chug chug, chug chug, chug chug.'",,,
btm_sub_mode_intro_110,"It was crazy.",,,
btm_sub_mode_intro_120,They set off in search of fame and fortune, but what they found along the way is that dreams could sometimes become nightmares.,,,
btm_sub_mode_intro_130,"Being in a van with that many people is challenging.",,,
btm_sub_mode_intro_140,"I don't think I've ever witnessed a band on stage implode.",,,
btm_sub_mode_intro_160,Grab your favorite shovel and get ready for an excavation of the truth beneath a rock and roll legend.,,,
btm_sub_mode_intro_170,This is the story beneath the tuneage.,,,
btm_sub_show_10_intro_010,The year was 2014.,,,
btm_sub_show_10_intro_020,In the decades since the much-lauded Budd F. Bonkazoids show, the band had skyrocketed into the stratosphere of superstardom.,,,
btm_sub_show_10_intro_030,"There are people who want to be in bands, and then there are musicians. These were musicians.",,,
btm_sub_show_10_intro_040,December 31st, 2014.,,,
btm_sub_show_10_intro_050,The band receives another boost when their best-known song is covered by an up-and-coming artist.,,,
btm_sub_show_10_intro_060,"We were obviously big fans, we had been for a long time, and then that ended up being a huge hit for us, so it really worked out.",,,
btm_sub_show_10_intro_070,And the band would get another shock straight to the spinal cord when their original demos, which had been stolen from the drummer's underpants drawer in 1989, were suddenly uncovered.,,,
btm_sub_show_10_intro_080,"Oops! Here they are. I got them in a normal way!",,,
btm_sub_show_10_intro_090,High on life, the band receives the opportunity of a lifetime: a sure-to-be-epic show at Corporate Stadium in Manhattan City, New York.,,,
btm_sub_show_10_intro_100,"An opportunity like that is once in a lifetime.",,,
btm_sub_show_10_intro_110,But after all these years, could the band still knock it out of the park? Or would they strike out?,,,
btm_sub_show_10_results_010_good,The show was more than a success, it was the stuff of legends.,,,
btm_sub_show_10_results_010_rough,Although the band's final performance fell below their high expectations, the crowd was willing to overlook their missteps.,,,
btm_sub_show_10_results_020,"It was beyond epic.",,,
btm_sub_show_10_results_030,"It just slapped me in the face and it just showed me everything that was great about rock and roll.",,,
btm_sub_show_10_results_040,The performance catapulted the band to mythic status, turning them from a household name into a rock and roll fairy tale.,,,
btm_sub_show_10_results_050,"I played them so much I think people were gonna start to talk. Everybody wanted to hear that song.",,,
btm_sub_show_10_results_060,"Yeah, it was crazy 'cause we used to play with them, and then now we see 'em on TV and we see 'em all over the place and it's pretty surreal.",,,
btm_sub_show_10_results_070,But after so many action-packed chapters, how would the band's epic fable end?,,,
btm_sub_show_1_intro_010,October 8th, 1989.,,,
btm_sub_show_1_intro_020,The band forms in high school biology class during a particularly boring lesson.,,,
btm_sub_show_1_intro_030,"I was trying to teach those kids something useful.",,,
btm_sub_show_1_intro_040,"But they were busy yapping about making a band.",,,
btm_sub_show_1_intro_050,"'You got to focus,' I told 'em.",,,
btm_sub_show_1_intro_060,"'Else you're gonna wind up working at the poop factory over on Sixth Street.'",,,
btm_sub_show_1_intro_070,"They didn't listen.",,,
btm_sub_show_1_intro_080,"I was in that class that day. Totally.",,,
btm_sub_show_1_intro_090,"They were like, 'Oh, let's start a band.'",,,
btm_sub_show_1_intro_100,"I'm like, 'Cool! Can I be in it?'",,,
btm_sub_show_1_intro_110,"They're like, 'God, Terry, no! Shut up!'",,,
btm_sub_show_1_intro_120,"It was awesome.",,,
btm_sub_show_1_intro_130,March 17th, 1990.,,,
btm_sub_show_1_intro_140,Having practiced for a total of thirty-three minutes, the band was ready to play their first-ever show.,,,
btm_sub_show_1_intro_150,At Budd F. Bonkazoid's: a local amusement center for kids and incredibly uncool teens.,,,
btm_sub_show_1_intro_160,But could the fledgling band draw a crowd?,,,
btm_sub_show_1_results_010,Despite an underwhelming turnout, the Budd F. Bonkazoids show garnered the band tremendous word of mouth.,,,
btm_sub_show_1_results_020,"All of a sudden, there was so much buzz.",,,
btm_sub_show_1_results_030,"Yeah, it was crazy how much people were really talking about that show, 'cause...",,,
btm_sub_show_1_results_040,"Yeah, there was, like, only one really weird guy there.",,,
btm_sub_show_1_results_050,"No exaggeration: greatest show in the entire history of music.",,,
btm_sub_show_1_results_070_bass,The crowd unanimously agreed that the bassist was the real star of the show.,,,
btm_sub_show_1_results_070_drums,The crowd unanimously agreed that the drummer absolutely crushed it.,,,
btm_sub_show_1_results_070_guitar,The crowd unanimously agreed that the guitarist stole the spotlight.,,,
btm_sub_show_1_results_070_vocals,The crowd unanimously agreed that the singer was truly magnetic.,,,
btm_sub_show_1_results_080_bass,"It was like: [BASS SOUNDS]",,,
btm_sub_show_1_results_080_drums,"It was like: [DRUM SOUNDS]",,,
btm_sub_show_1_results_080_guitar,"It was like: [GUITAR SOUNDS]",,,
btm_sub_show_1_results_080_vocals,"It was like: [TUNELESS SINGING]",,,
btm_sub_show_1_results_090,But it remained to be seen whether the band could keep up their momentous momentum.,,,
btm_sub_show_2_intro_010,September 1st, 1991.,,,
btm_sub_show_2_intro_020,With a tornado of support swirling at their backs, the band decided to enter the local Battle of the Bands taking place in their high school gymnasium.,,,
btm_sub_show_2_results_010_good,The band's killer performance wins them the Battle of the Bands, even though young Nicholas Mudry's original poem recitation was a big hit with all the lame parents.,,,
btm_sub_show_2_results_010_rough,The band's imperfect performance at the Battle of the Bands lands them third place, directly behind Junior Katchanovski, who performed "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" in armpit farts.,,,
btm_sub_show_2_results_020,"After that show they really blew up on the scene.",,,
btm_sub_show_2_results_030,"Those kids may have been hooligans, but I tell you what: that was some damn fine musicianship at that battle.",,,
btm_sub_show_2_results_060,The band didn't need a fancy participation certificate to know that the community thought they were solid platinum.,,,
btm_sub_show_2_results_070,Or gold, I guess.,,,
btm_sub_show_3_intro_010,November 23rd.,,,
btm_sub_show_3_intro_020,Thanks to their attention-getting performance at the high school gym, the band was turning more heads than a full court buzzer beater.,,,
btm_sub_show_3_intro_030,"Yeah, that's about when I started selling merch for them.",,,
btm_sub_show_3_intro_040,"They said they'd pay me in college credit, but I didn't go to college.",,,
btm_sub_show_3_intro_050,"Then they said if I didn't shut up I'd be attending 'the University of Butt Punch.'",,,
btm_sub_show_3_intro_060,Amid all the buzz, the band was asked to play a matinee with a killer lineup at the nearby Horned Owl Lodge, featuring local legends Moosejaw Boudreau and the Beaver Tail Boys.,,,
btm_sub_show_3_intro_070,"Amazing bill. That's the kind of lineup that you dream of being a part of.",,,
btm_sub_show_3_intro_080,But with all eyes on them, would the performance add fuel to the band's fire? Or would they go down in flames?,,,
btm_sub_show_3_results_010_good,After the young band's stellar performance, everyone at the Horned Owl was wondering "hoo hoo" they were.,,,
btm_sub_show_3_results_010_rough,The troubled performance at the Horned Owl had many folks wondering if the band was already "owl" washed up.,,,
btm_sub_show_3_results_030,"All I know is Moosejaw was impressed. He was like, 'I don't even know how they can play like that without guitar straps.'",,,
btm_sub_show_3_results_040,After getting featured in the well-respected hardcore zine "Angry, Loud and Shorn," the band decided to put it all on the line and head out on tour.,,,
btm_sub_show_3_results_050,"I told 'em, 'It's a big mistake.'",,,
btm_sub_show_3_results_060,"'This rock music thing is just a phase.'",,,
btm_sub_show_3_results_070,"'Get a job with some stability, like the automobile industry. Or modems.'",,,
btm_sub_show_3_results_080,Despite these warnings ringing out like ringly-dingly bells, the band forged ahead, leaving behind everything they'd ever known on a tour of destiny.,,,
btm_sub_show_3_results_090,"Life on the road is no joke. It's not for everyone.",,,
btm_sub_show_3_results_100,But would their dangerous gamble pay off, or would their dreams fade away like fading dreams?,,,
btm_sub_show_3_results_110,Next, on Beneath the Tuneage.,,,
btm_sub_show_4a_intro_010,The year was 1997.,,,
btm_sub_show_4a_intro_020,The band's nonstop touring had gained them fans and followers from Tallahassee to Texarkana.,,,
btm_sub_show_4a_intro_030,"Everywhere they went the shows were packed.",,,
btm_sub_show_4a_intro_040,"It was nuts.",,,
btm_sub_show_4a_intro_050,"I hear songs from them twenty years later and I can immediately say, 'I remember them playing that song that night.'",,,
btm_sub_show_4a_intro_060,Unwilling to sign away their song rights, the band declined a major label deal and instead created their own independent label: Narwhal Fist Records.,,,
btm_sub_show_4a_intro_070,"I had every single record on Narwhal Fist when it came out.",,,
btm_sub_show_4a_intro_080,"Oh yeah. Absolutely.",,,
btm_sub_show_4a_intro_090,"You know, the Crummy Nummers...who else was on that?",,,
btm_sub_show_4a_intro_100,"Forbidden Swamp.",,,
btm_sub_show_4a_intro_110,"Forbidden Swamp, Forbidden Swamp.",,,
btm_sub_show_4a_intro_120,"The Doodiehead, Doodiehead Boys. First album.",,,
btm_sub_show_4a_intro_130,The first album on the band's new label was their own, available only on limited edition LP on orange vinyl.,,,
btm_sub_show_4a_intro_140,"That album was super influential.",,,
btm_sub_show_4a_intro_150,"That was the first album that really just slammed you in the face.",,,
btm_sub_show_4a_intro_160,"That record was progressive.",,,
btm_sub_show_4a_intro_170,"See, nobody at that time was doing all covers.",,,
btm_sub_show_4a_intro_180,"The fact that they were brave enough to do an all-cover record was mind-blowing.",,,
btm_sub_show_4a_intro_200,On the verge of indie superstardom, the band prepared for their biggest show yet at the legendary outback music festival, Soiled Man.,,,
btm_sub_show_4a_intro_210,"Man, those festivals can really put you on the map.",,,
btm_sub_show_4a_intro_220,But could they draw a crowd in the desert or would their big performance end up deserted?,,,
btm_sub_show_4a_results_010_good,The band's flawless performance at Soiled Man earned them tremendous attention.,,,
btm_sub_show_4a_results_010_rough,Despite the band's flawed performance at Soiled Man, their unpredictable behavior nonetheless earned them tremendous attention.,,,
btm_sub_show_4a_results_020,"Boom. They're superstars.",,,
btm_sub_show_4a_results_030,"Yeah, you couldn't go anywhere without hearing about them.",,,
btm_sub_show_4a_results_040,"It was really annoying.",,,
btm_sub_show_4a_results_050,But the band's image as rule-breaking rebels created a problem when their increasingly popular debut album was accused of containing subliminal messages.,,,
btm_sub_show_4a_results_060,"Well, when played in reverse, this album...",,,
btm_sub_show_4a_results_070,"It contains horrid, just horrid!, messages.",,,
btm_sub_show_4a_results_080,"I don't know what these other quote-unquote 'parents' are thinking, allowing their children to listen to that filth.",,,
btm_sub_show_4a_results_100,And after the band is attacked in the right-wing media for inadvertently throwing away a flag-printed napkin at a corn dog stand, they went on a campaign to improve their media image.,,,
btm_sub_show_4b_intro_010,The year was 1999.,,,
btm_sub_show_4b_intro_020,Nearly a decade had passed since the band set off on their fateful mission to lasso the music world by the neck, a mission which had been a success.,,,
btm_sub_show_4b_intro_030,"They were amazing. And I just was like, 'They're gonna be huge.'",,,
btm_sub_show_4b_intro_040,After signing to the mighty Global Mogul Records for a reportedly enormous fee, the band recorded their first album, cleverly titled "Self-Titled.",,,
btm_sub_show_4b_intro_050,"The first album was just hauntingly beautiful.",,,
btm_sub_show_4b_intro_060,"That record was big. It was in heavy rotation.",,,
btm_sub_show_4b_intro_070,"You'd just be in awe when you saw them effortlessly play it live.",,,
btm_sub_show_4b_intro_080,On the verge of huge mainstream success, the band prepared for their first stadium show at the Mondo Dome in Chicago, Illinois.,,,
btm_sub_show_4b_intro_090,"The thing about a big show is that it's very scary.",,,
btm_sub_show_4b_intro_100,"It's just make or break at that point.",,,
btm_sub_show_4b_intro_110,"Can you get through it? Are you gonna choke or are you just gonna bring it?",,,
btm_sub_show_4b_intro_120,With the stakes this high, would the band flop like a bad pizza joint?,,,
btm_sub_show_4b_intro_130,Or, like a good pizza joint, would they deliver?,,,
btm_sub_show_4b_results_010_good,After an epic performance at the Mondo Dome, the band had become bigger and hotter than the Sierra Madre mountains.,,,
btm_sub_show_4b_results_010_rough,After a lackluster performance at the Mondo Dome, the band was ready to run for the hills.,,,
btm_sub_show_4b_results_015_rough,But their fame only increased unabated.,,,
btm_sub_show_4b_results_020,"That band was huge.",,,
btm_sub_show_4b_results_030,"They were the thing, the biggest thing at that moment.",,,
btm_sub_show_4b_results_040,"My mom called me and she was all excited that I was touring with them.",,,
btm_sub_show_4b_results_050,"Then the guitar player got on the phone and asked my mom out on a date.",,,
btm_sub_show_4b_results_060,"And she said yes.",,,
btm_sub_show_4b_results_070,"Then they went out for all-you-can-eat pasta.",,,
btm_sub_show_4b_results_080,Reveling in their global name recognition, the band had become a live wire, hissing and spitting rock and roll voltage.,,,
btm_sub_show_4b_results_090,"Oh man. The partying? They were trashing hotel rooms, spending money left and right...",,,
btm_sub_show_4b_results_100,"They were living it up. Constant drama.",,,
btm_sub_show_4b_results_110,"This band is never allowed back at the Verb Hotel.",,,
btm_sub_show_4b_results_120,"They tipped me $1700 on a $12 bill.",,,
btm_sub_show_4b_results_130,"The singer paid me $9000 to change my name to Hot Dog Jones.",,,
btm_sub_show_4b_results_140,"I had student loans, so...",,,
btm_sub_show_4b_results_150,"So they really liked how the record came out, and they bought me an island.",,,
btm_sub_show_4b_results_160,"It's not a particularly nice island, there's a lot of snakes, but still.",,,
btm_sub_show_4b_results_180,But this live wire also shocked anyone who got in their way.,,,
btm_sub_show_5a_intro_010,April 12th, 1999.,,,
btm_sub_show_5a_intro_020,The band is offered a headliner slot at Help-Aid, a widely promoted international charity concert raising money for folks in need.,,,
btm_sub_show_5a_intro_030,"The band loved doing benefits. They never cared about money.",,,
btm_sub_show_5a_intro_040,"Even when they owed their manager $47 for gas.",,,
btm_sub_show_5a_intro_050,"That band was wonderful to our organization.",,,
btm_sub_show_5a_intro_060,"They knew there's nothing more baller than doing good in the world.",,,
btm_sub_show_5a_intro_070,But would the band's benefit end up...not benefiting the band?,,,
btm_sub_show_5a_results_010_good,Despite their impeccable performance at the benefit, the band was yet again embroiled in drama when Help-Aid was revealed to benefit a controversial organization.,,,
btm_sub_show_5a_results_010_rough,After a bewildering performance at the benefit, the band was yet again embroiled in drama when Help-Aid was revealed to benefit a controversial organization.,,,
btm_sub_show_5a_results_020,"Our organization provides free endangered whale meat to prison cafeterias.",,,
btm_sub_show_5a_results_030,Things went from bad to worse for the band after the drummer was arrested for attacking a paparazzo.,,,
btm_sub_show_5a_results_040,"The guy came out of nowhere and, like, 'Ka-pow!' Like, right in the ear.",,,
btm_sub_show_5a_results_060,"All I know is: that guy, Papa Razzo or whatever? He had it coming.",,,
btm_sub_show_5a_results_070,And when the guitarist's landlord/ex-brother-in-law published a scathing tell-all memoir, the band's reputation was at an all-time low.,,,
btm_sub_show_5a_results_080,"Yeah, I wrote a tell-all book. I needed the money for a sous vide machine.",,,
btm_sub_show_5a_results_090,"I don't even feel bad.",,,
btm_sub_show_5a_results_100,"The press was just killing them, but in reality they brought it upon themselves.",,,
btm_sub_show_5a_results_110,But amid all the harsh press, would the band press on? Or would they stop the presses?,,,
btm_sub_show_5b_intro_010,May 17th, 2000.,,,
btm_sub_show_5b_intro_020,The band is offered a headliner slot on Cruisin' for a Bruisin', a notoriously out-of-control rock and roll-themed cruise liner.,,,
btm_sub_show_5b_intro_030,"Those cruises were out of hand.",,,
btm_sub_show_5b_intro_040,"I once saw a guy chug, like, five sodas. Not even diet!",,,
btm_sub_show_5b_intro_050,"Yeah, I mean, there's partying and then there's partying.",,,
btm_sub_show_5b_intro_060,But would the band sail into the sunset? Or would the show be a titanic disaster?,,,
btm_sub_show_5b_results_010_good,Aboard the cruise liner the band gave a performance to remember, but little did they know that out in the crowd a storm was brewing that everyone would soon be desperate to forget.,,,
btm_sub_show_5b_results_010_rough,Aboard the cruise liner the band's performance verged on disastrous, but little did they know that the real disaster awaited them out in the crowd.,,,
btm_sub_show_5b_results_020,"It was...it was a living nightmare.",,,
btm_sub_show_5b_results_030,"Sometimes I close my eyes and I can still hear the screaming.",,,
btm_sub_show_5b_results_040,Thanks to one partygoer's lax handwashing hygiene and the single set of tongs at the Ham Hut, the crowd experienced a devastating norovirus epidemic.,,,
btm_sub_show_5b_results_050,"Man...there was just poop everywhere.",,,
btm_sub_show_5b_results_060,"And people were barfing everywhere too. Because of all the poop.",,,
btm_sub_show_5b_results_070,"It was wretched-smelling.",,,
btm_sub_show_5b_results_075,[PENSIVE SILENCE],,,
btm_sub_show_5b_results_080,"I mean, people starting calling them 'the poop band.'",,,
btm_sub_show_5b_results_090,"It was brutal.",,,
btm_sub_show_5b_results_100,"I can't imagine living through something like that.",,,
btm_sub_show_5b_results_110,Shocked and devastated, the band was at a crucial crossroads of uncertainty.,,,
btm_sub_show_6a_intro_010,May 40th, 2000.,,,
btm_sub_show_6a_intro_020,Dogged by a press with an unyielding thirst for scandal, the band decides to make a major change.,,,
btm_sub_show_6a_intro_030,"They were always in the tabloids.",,,
btm_sub_show_6a_intro_040,"And I should know, because they made me buy them magazines.",,,
btm_sub_show_6a_intro_050,"With my own money.",,,
btm_sub_show_6a_intro_060,Hoping for a fresh start, the band decided to change their iconic look in the hopes of starting fresh.,,,
btm_sub_show_6a_intro_070,"At that point they just wanted to do whatever it took to change their image.",,,
btm_sub_show_6a_intro_080,But would their fans appreciate the band's new image? Or would the fashion update end up cramping their style?,,,
btm_sub_show_6a_results_010_good,The crowd was invigorated by the band's powerful performance and energized by their bold new look.,,,
btm_sub_show_6a_results_010_rough,Much of the crowd felt unenthusiastic about the band's performance and dismayed by the band's strange new look.,,,
btm_sub_show_6a_results_020_good,Outside the venue, audience members expressed their enthusiasm by starting a riot in the parking lot.,,,
btm_sub_show_6a_results_020_rough,Outside the venue, audience members expressed their displeasure by starting a riot in the parking lot.,,,
btm_sub_show_6a_results_030,"The crowd was out of control.",,,
btm_sub_show_6a_results_040,"Uh, life threatening. Very life threatening, yup. Feared for my life. No [EXPLETIVE].",,,
btm_sub_show_6a_results_050,In an effort to escape the out of control crowd, the band fled the venue in their tour bus only to experience a catastrophe to rival the greatest tragedies in human history.,,,
btm_sub_show_6a_results_060,"I don't even like to think about it anymore.",,,
btm_sub_show_6a_results_070,As their bus peeled out of the parking lot at a breathtaking 14 miles per hour, the unsecured bag of crunchy tacos that the band was saving for after the show went skidding down the center aisle.,,,
btm_sub_show_6a_results_080,"Yeah, I mean, it was, it was just...",,,
btm_sub_show_6a_results_090,Though the band members tried to save their snack, the tacos were annihilated.,,,
btm_sub_show_6a_results_100,"You just wanted to go up to 'em and wrap your arms around 'em and say, 'Dude. This sucks.'",,,
btm_sub_show_6a_results_110,Their emotions crushed like crispy corn tortilla shells, and feeling as ground down as zesty beef, the band was at a delicious breaking point.,,,
btm_sub_show_6a_results_120,But could they turn things around? Up next on Beneath the Tuneage.,,,
btm_sub_show_6b_intro_010,June 3rd, 2000.,,,
btm_sub_show_6b_intro_020,Haunted by the horrors they had witnessed aboard the Cruisin' for a Bruisin', the band plotted a course for spiritual healing.,,,
btm_sub_show_6b_intro_030,"They really needed a way to forget what they had seen.",,,
btm_sub_show_6b_intro_040,Hoping for a fresh start, the band sought the guidance of a trendy healer mystic known as Swami Ben.,,,
btm_sub_show_6b_intro_050,"Swami Ben Goldstein.",,,
btm_sub_show_6b_intro_060,"A very interesting figure.",,,
btm_sub_show_6b_intro_070,"He was very charismatic.",,,
btm_sub_show_6b_intro_080,"Had lots of followers.",,,
btm_sub_show_6b_intro_090,"Yeah, the band was really into that spiritual stuff.",,,
btm_sub_show_6b_intro_100,After several weeks of spiritual rehabilitation, the band agreed to play a show for the guru's many devotees.,,,
btm_sub_show_6b_results_010_good,Despite the success of the show, the band becomes concerned that Swami Ben and his flock might actually be a more sinister organization than they had anticipated.,,,
btm_sub_show_6b_results_010_rough,Though they tried to focus the band gave a flustered performance, distracted by concern that Swami Ben and his flock might actually be a more sinister organization than they had anticipated.,,,
btm_sub_show_6b_results_020,"Oh, yeah, they were a cult. A hundred percent, absolutely.",,,
btm_sub_show_6b_results_030,"Was that somehow not immediately obvious to everyone?",,,
btm_sub_show_6b_results_040,After fleeing the ashram, safe from the cult's clutches and back on the road, the band is blindly blindsided when tragedy viciously strikes.,,,
btm_sub_show_6b_results_050,"It was the hardest thing any of us had ever been through.",,,
btm_sub_show_6b_results_060,While touring through western Pennsylvania, the band's worst nightmare comes true when their beloved merch boy Trevor unexpectedly passes away.,,,
btm_sub_show_6b_results_070,"We all loved Trevor so much. It was so, it was so painful.",,,
btm_sub_show_6b_results_080,"When Trevor died, it was beyond devastating. It was soul-crushing.",,,
btm_sub_show_6b_results_090,"Yeah. I didn't die.",,,
btm_sub_show_6b_results_100,"They forgot I was in the bathroom at the truck stop and they left without me.",,,
btm_sub_show_6b_results_110,"That was the fourth worst day of my life.",,,
btm_sub_show_6b_results_120,"I remember one night asking them if they wanted to order pizza, and they were like, 'No.'",,,
btm_sub_show_6b_results_130,"'Let's get wings. It's what Trevor would have wanted.'",,,
btm_sub_show_6b_results_140,"I don't even like wings! They make your hands all gross.",,,
btm_sub_show_6b_results_150,While still grieving the loss of their revered merch boy...,,,
btm_sub_show_6b_results_160,"Trevor, man. R.I.P.",,,
btm_sub_show_6b_results_170,...the band is dealt a crushing blow when they learn that, amid all the drama, they have been dropped from their label.,,,
btm_sub_show_6b_results_180,"They were barely holding it together.",,,
btm_sub_show_6b_results_190,"It was bad. It was not good.",,,
btm_sub_show_6b_results_200,But would the new year turn things around for the band?,,,
btm_sub_show_6b_results_210,Or would 2003 be the year that the band called it quits, on their oversized flip phones?,,,
btm_sub_show_6b_results_220,That's up next on Beneath the Tuneage.,,,
btm_sub_show_7a_intro_010,February 6th, 2006.,,,
btm_sub_show_7a_intro_020,The band has had a challenging run.,,,
btm_sub_show_7a_intro_030,"Things were, things were dark.",,,
btm_sub_show_7a_intro_040,"The stage banter was awkward and the chemistry on stage was kind of weird and it was, like, palpable.",,,
btm_sub_show_7a_intro_050,"I'm like, 'This band is not gonna last.'",,,
btm_sub_show_7a_intro_060,After receiving a series of invitations/threats from a fan going by the handle "IntenseCarl77"...,,,
btm_sub_show_7a_intro_070,"What? Hi, I'm Carl.",,,
btm_sub_show_7a_intro_080,...the band agreed to play a small, well-paying show at his private residence.,,,
btm_sub_show_7a_intro_090,"What's your name?",,,
btm_sub_show_7a_intro_100,But would their most devoted fan turn things around for the band?,,,
btm_sub_show_7a_intro_110,Or would the doody hit the fan?,,,
btm_sub_show_7a_results_010_good,Though they didn't let it show in their immaculate performance, the band found Intense Carl's basement concert extremely dis-concert-ing.,,,
btm_sub_show_7a_results_010_rough,Though they tried to play their best, the band's performance was noticeably impacted by their incredibly creepy surroundings in Intense Carl's basement.,,,
btm_sub_show_7a_results_020,"I made dolls shaped like the members of the band and then I placed the dolls on an altar and I married them dressed as Nergle, Second Lord of the Underworld.",,,
btm_sub_show_7a_results_030,"Then we had apple juice.",,,
btm_sub_show_7a_results_040,[SHOCKED FACES],,,
btm_sub_show_7a_results_050,Feeling anxious about that,,,
btm_sub_show_7a_results_060,"The show was in the basement in my house! Where I live.",,,
btm_sub_show_7a_results_070,Feeling terrified and fragile from being in their superfan's ultra-creepy home, the band was at an all-time low.,,,
btm_sub_show_7a_results_080,"Do you have any pet animals? I like pet animals.",,,
btm_sub_show_7a_results_090,But how low would they go?,,,
btm_sub_show_7b_intro_010,The year: 2004.,,,
btm_sub_show_7b_intro_020,Time has not been kind to the band, and neither has the public.,,,
btm_sub_show_7b_intro_030,"They were suffering. It was obvious.",,,
btm_sub_show_7b_intro_040,"I actually heard that the bass player was working at some sort of, like...poop factory.",,,
btm_sub_show_7b_intro_050,Desperate for cash, the band agreed to play a birthday party for the bassist's dermatologist's pet dog, a friendly but incontinent Tibetan Terrier named Fritzy.,,,
btm_sub_show_7b_intro_060,"It makes perfect sense to me. Only dogs should be listening to that garbage.",,,
btm_sub_show_7b_intro_070,"But even then, not the nice breeds.",,,
btm_sub_show_7b_intro_080,But would the show turn the band into top dogs? Or would they end up with a nasty case of the fleas?,,,
btm_sub_show_7b_results_010_good,Though their performance was spectacular, the band still wound up feeling like dog meat.,,,
btm_sub_show_7b_results_010_rough,Perhaps crestfallen by how far they had fallen, the band gave a subpar performance, disappointing both Fritzy and her handlers.,,,
btm_sub_show_7b_results_020,"They played a show for a dog?",,,
btm_sub_show_7b_results_030,"I didn't know that! Are you for real?",,,
btm_sub_show_7b_results_040,[LAUGHING],,,
btm_sub_show_7b_results_050,"This is why you got to listen to your teacher. So you don't end up sad.",,,
btm_sub_show_7b_results_060,It was a freaking dog's birthday party. I mean, that's pretty bad.,,,
btm_sub_show_7b_results_070,Moving on.,,,
btm_sub_show_8a_intro_010,August Durf, 2007.,,,
btm_sub_show_8a_intro_020,The band is offered the chance to perform at a mixer for real estate agents at a mid-range realty firm.,,,
btm_sub_show_8a_intro_030,"Now I would never play a show like that in a million years.",,,
btm_sub_show_8a_intro_040,"The life, the clothes, the, nope. Not doing it.",,,
btm_sub_show_8a_intro_050,"What's embarrassing about doing a gig for real estate agents? I mean, you can't do realty without keeping it real.",,,
btm_sub_show_8a_intro_060,"YOLO.",,,
btm_sub_show_8a_intro_070,Desperate for a payday, they hopped at the chance like a bunch of cash-strapped Easter bunnies.,,,
btm_sub_show_8a_results_010_good,Thanks to the band's exceptional performance, the crowd went wild.,,,
btm_sub_show_8a_results_010_rough,Even after a somewhat bungled performance by the band, the crowd had a great time.,,,
btm_sub_show_8a_results_020,"And I almost sold their bassist a timeshare in Boca.",,,
btm_sub_show_8a_results_030,"But it ultimately didn't work out. Just not the right time.",,,
btm_sub_show_8a_results_040,But despite the crowd's enthusiasm, they were still just a bunch of lame loser real estate agents that no one cared about.,,,
btm_sub_show_8a_results_050,Frustrated by the turn their careers had taken, the band was unsure whether to dust themselves off...,,,
btm_sub_show_8a_results_060,"They were right on the verge of quitting.",,,
btm_sub_show_8a_results_070,"They were done.",,,
btm_sub_show_8a_results_080,...or whether they had already been left in the dust.,,,
btm_sub_show_8b_intro_010,Morch 19th, 2007.,,,
btm_sub_show_8b_intro_020,Hoping to gain some semblance of dignity, the band emigrates to Gurdzblechistan and attempts to hide their true identities.,,,
btm_sub_show_8b_intro_030,"Yeah, actually, my country has a long history of supporting things that are no longer cool in America.",,,
btm_sub_show_8b_intro_040,"Like, uh, slap bracelets. And, uh, this band.",,,
btm_sub_show_8b_intro_050,Humiliated but still burning to make music, the band performs a show in disguise under a false name.,,,
btm_sub_show_8b_intro_060,But would the disguises end up being a blessing in disguise?,,,
btm_sub_show_8b_results_010_good,Thanks in part to the band's breathtaking performance, the show was a huge triumph.,,,
btm_sub_show_8b_results_010_rough,Though the band's performance was far from perfect, the crowd seemed accepting of their flaws.,,,
btm_sub_show_8b_results_020,"Yeah, but in general if we make it out of a show and no one has stolen our motorbikes, we consider that a big success.",,,
btm_sub_show_8b_results_030,Under their new name and identity, the band became increasingly popular in Gurdzblechistan, due in part to the fact that their new band name translated to an obscene Gurdzblechi phrase.,,,
btm_sub_show_8b_results_040,"Yeah, the name, the name...",,,
btm_sub_show_8b_results_050,"In my language it translates to 'Sensual Goat Party.'",,,
btm_sub_show_8b_results_060,"Which is more of a formal goat party.",,,
btm_sub_show_8b_results_070,"You know, they wear bow tie, and top hat...it's nice.",,,
btm_sub_show_8b_results_080,Despite the increased attention, the band was experiencing a crushing homesickness, the weight of which was likely to crush them.,,,
btm_sub_show_8b_results_090,"It's common to be homesick in my country.",,,
btm_sub_show_8b_results_100,"There's a scent in the air like, uh, elderly teeth.",,,
btm_sub_show_8b_results_110,"I mean, we're used to it, but the foreigners not so much.",,,
btm_sub_show_8b_results_120,Knowing that there was pain, could the band hold on for one more day and break free? Break from the chains?,,,
btm_sub_show_9a_intro_010,July 3rd, 2008.,,,
btm_sub_show_9a_intro_020,At an all-time low, the band decides to play one final show at the site of their famous first performance before cashing it in.,,,
btm_sub_show_9a_intro_030,"I did not want the band to break up because I did not want to have to do anything rash.",,,
btm_sub_show_9a_intro_040,But would this be the band's last show?,,,
btm_sub_show_9a_intro_050,"No!",,,
btm_sub_show_9a_intro_060,Or...would it...not be?,,,
btm_sub_show_9a_results_010_good,In sharp contrast to the band's first show with its pathetic audience of one, the band's second performance at Budd F. Bonkazoids was an enormous success, the packed house energized by the band's skillful show.,,,
btm_sub_show_9a_results_010_rough,In sharp contrast to the band's first show with its pathetic audience of one, the band's second performance at Budd F. Bonkazoids was very well attended, and despite the band's less than flawless performance, the crowd was forgiving.,,,
btm_sub_show_9a_results_020,"The crowd was beyond packed. It was sold out in minutes.",,,
btm_sub_show_9a_results_030,"There were people lined up down the block waiting to get in.",,,
btm_sub_show_9a_results_040,"Everybody was just trying to get up to the very front of the stage.",,,
btm_sub_show_9a_results_050,The intimate local performance was heralded by the press as "humble," "endearing," "the height of class," and "just really [EXPLETIVE] cool.",,,
btm_sub_show_9a_results_060,"I was like, 'Yes. That's how it's done.'",,,
btm_sub_show_9a_results_070,The band's star was once again on the rise, but what would their future hold?,,,
btm_sub_show_9a_results_080,That's up next on Beneath the Tuneage.,,,
btm_sub_show_9b_intro_010,Octoberty 19th, 2008.,,,
btm_sub_show_9b_intro_020,At an all-time low, the band decides to give it their all with one final blowout show at the grandest amphitheater in Gurdzblechistan.,,,
btm_sub_show_9b_intro_030,"We actually have a nicer theater but we use it to store grain.",,,
btm_sub_show_9b_intro_040,"Everybody assumed they were over.",,,
btm_sub_show_9b_intro_050,"Yeah, I think they were ready to break up for sure.",,,
btm_sub_show_9b_intro_060,"It's rock and roll. It's a business. It's tough sometimes, and it can be ugly.",,,
btm_sub_show_9b_intro_070,But could this be the show that changed everything for the band, in a good way?,,,
btm_sub_show_9b_results_010_good,After an extraordinary performance at their hugely successful "final" concert, the band found themselves the biggest band in the Eastern Bloc.,,,
btm_sub_show_9b_results_010_rough,Although the band didn't achieve their goal of technical perfection, the crowd's love for the band was unwavering.,,,
btm_sub_show_9b_results_020,"The show was packed to the rafters.",,,
btm_sub_show_9b_results_030,"Every single kid was just going ape-[EXPLETIVE] the entire time.",,,
btm_sub_show_9b_results_040,"It was this massive amount of people moving, like, back and forth, front, back...",,,
btm_sub_show_9b_results_050,"I could feel the pounding of the kick drum in my heart.",,,
btm_sub_show_9b_results_060,As word of the band's true identity began to leak out...,,,
btm_sub_show_9b_results_070,"Wait. That, that was them?",,,
btm_sub_show_9b_results_090,[SOUND OF HEAD EXPLODING],,,
btm_sub_show_9b_results_100,...the press began heralding the band as "bold," "full of integrity," and "culturally conscious.",,,
btm_sub_show_9b_results_110,"They come out swinging like that and it's progressive, it's forward-thinking...",,,
btm_sub_show_9b_results_130,"Hell yeah. That was a cool, cool move.",,,
btm_sub_show_9b_results_140,And after appearing on a music review site's Top 100 list, the band's kite made out of success was soaring high.,,,
btm_sub_show_9b_results_150,"All of a sudden it was like, 'Maybe they can make it after all.'",,,
btm_sub_show_9b_results_160,The band was gaining respect all over the world. But what would their future hold?,,,
btm_sub_show_9b_results_170,That's up next on Beneath the Tuneage.,,,

delete_band_reason_01,Decided it's time to pursue that "experimental noise" solo project, have you?,,,
delete_band_reason_02,Leaving the band gives you the time you needed to focus on your true passion: onion rings.,,,
delete_band_reason_03,Well, that probably means it's time to get a job. Sorry about that.,,,
delete_band_reason_04,Don't think of it as a break-up so much as an... um... yeah, it's a break-up.,,,
delete_band_reason_05,Apparently the bass player ran away with your original guitar player (who happens to be the drummer's ex) and things got... complicated.,,,
delete_band_reason_06,Sometimes band members just wake up and realize, "Wow, we all hate each other more than words can say.",,,
delete_band_reason_07,Guess you just couldn't get past all the hurt feelings after "The Great Drum Solo Debate of 2012.",,,
delete_band_reason_08,Apparently, the guitar player mentioned that the singer's high notes were "slightly off." Things went downhill startlingly quickly from there.,,,
delete_band_reason_09,The word is that no one ever restocked the practice space fridge, so there was really no motivation to show up for practice.,,,
delete_band_reason_10,You realized that if you just broke up the band, you'd never have to haul another unnecessarily oversized pedal board again!,,,
delete_band_reason_11,As is the case with so many musicians, at some point you realized that pretty much anything pays better than making music for a living.,,,
delete_band_reason_12,Surprisingly, there was just no market for your recent album of family-friendly, patriotic death metal songs.,,,
delete_band_reason_13,Perhaps you realized that most other hobbies require fewer heated arguments about whether alternate tunings are cool or not.,,,
delete_band_reason_14,Ostensibly you experienced the kiss of death for all rock bands: one of you got a job and started making actual money.,,,
delete_band_reason_15,You had to disband as a part of a very weird, very generous plea agreement.,,,
delete_band_reason_16,The good news is, now you have tons of time to write that scathing memoir, detailing every time you were "wronged" by your bandmates!,,,
delete_band_reason_17,Who needs a band anyway? It's really just a collection of random people, sweating profusely near one another.,,,
delete_band_reason_18,There really was no way to stay together after that "put a sleeping bandmate's hand in a bowl of warm water" prank went horribly awry.,,,
delete_band_reason_19,Perhaps you finally realized that no one shared your passion for 17-minute improvised bridge sections.,,,
delete_band_reason_20,Hopefully you can retain the rights to tour with that band name in the future. 'Cause it was really great.,,,
delete_band_reason_21,Leaving the band gives you the time you needed to focus on your true passion: napping.,,,
delete_band_reason_22,You never imagined that "borrowing" your bandmate's chicken parm sub was going to be such a huge deal. And yet, here you are.,,,
delete_band_reason_23,Without your bandmates, who is going to make you feel bad about always rhyming "drives me crazy" with "spaghetti bolognese.",,,
delete_band_reason_24,Phew, it was going to be such a hassle dealing with all that fame and success. What a relief!,,,

help_text_big_rock_ending_1,At the end of some songs, you'll have the opportunity for a Big Rock Ending. Shred on guitar or bass, or bang away on the drums like there's no tomorrow. But watch out for the notes at the end of the track!,,,
help_text_big_rock_ending_2,If you're playing as a band, then Big Rock Endings occur for all instruments. If you play a Big Rock Ending, you'll get a major score bonus, but only if you land those last notes.,,,
help_text_big_rock_ending_3,Not all songs have Big Rock Endings, so take advantage of the ones that do.,,,
help_text_big_rock_ending_header,Big Rock Endings,,,
help_text_calibration_1,With many television and sound setups, the audio and video may play at different times, making it difficult to play the right note at the right time. To calibrate your system, select Settings [[arrow]] Calibration from the Main Menu. From here, you can select Calibrate System to determine your calibration numbers, or select Enter Calibration Numbers to input them manually.,,,
help_text_calibration_10,Manual Calibration,,,
help_text_calibration_11,Manual Calibration is available for other instruments and controllers by default. For the Rock Band Wireless Fender Guitar Controller, press [[Blue Fret]] at the start of Automatic Calibration to switch to Manual.,,,
help_text_calibration_12,For Manual Audio Calibration, each time you hear a drum beat, press [[A]], strum, or hit [[green pad]] in time with the beat you hear.,,,
help_text_calibration_13,For Manual Video Calibration, when you see the needle hit either side of the meter, press [[A]], strum, or hit [[green pad]] in time with the needle.,,,
help_text_calibration_14,Enter Calibration Numbers,,,
help_text_calibration_15,If you're familiar with the calibration process, or if you feel you just can't get an ideal calibration using auto calibration or manual calibration, you can try setting your calibration numbers by hand. Select ENTER CALIBRATION NUMBERS from the Calibration menu and tweak each number directly. Here's an approach we recommend to find the best settings:,,,
help_text_calibration_16,You'll need a drum controller or guitar controller to use this method.,,,
help_text_calibration_17,This can be a complicated and time-consuming process, so you may want to attempt one of the other calibration methods first, so you have some decent numbers to start with.,,,
help_text_calibration_18,Video Calibration: Choose a song and select Easy difficulty. Mute the volume, and attempt to hit the notes. If you can't hit when the notes are directly over the target, then try hitting the notes when they are ABOVE the target, or BELOW the target.,,,
help_text_calibration_19,If you hit the notes when they are ABOVE the target, try a LOWER video calibration number.,,,
help_text_calibration_2,If you have a Rock Band Wireless Fender Guitar Controller, you can use it to automatically calibrate your system. Otherwise, or if you prefer to, you can use Manual Calibration.,,,
help_text_calibration_20,If you hit the notes when they are BELOW the target, try a HIGHER video calibration number.,,,
help_text_calibration_21,Audio Calibration: Now restart the same song, turn up the sound, turn away from the TV, and try to play the song without looking. If you can't hit the notes, try playing earlier or later than what you hear to hit the notes.,,,
help_text_calibration_22,If you hit the notes when you play EARLIER than what you hear, try a LOWER audio calibration number.,,,
help_text_calibration_23,If you hit the notes when you play LATER than what you hear, try a HIGHER audio calibration number.,,,
help_text_calibration_24,Repeat these steps until you feel like you've dialed in on the perfect calibration.,,,
help_text_calibration_3,IMPORTANT!,,,
help_text_calibration_4,Many TVs have a picture setting called Game Mode. Ensure this setting is turned ON to improve how quickly the game responds to your actions, which will make calibration more reliable.,,,
help_text_calibration_5,Automatic Calibration,,,
help_text_calibration_6,You can use Automatic Calibration by opening the Calibration menu while using a Rock Band Wireless Fender Guitar Controller.,,,
help_text_calibration_7,To calibrate your system's audio timing, when you are prompted, hold your Rock Band Wireless Fender Guitar Controller up to your sound system speaker or TV speaker (wherever the sound is coming from) as close as possible without touching. The volume should be set to a comfortable listening volume. If you have trouble in a room with a surround system, turning the volume down sometimes helps. Hold your guitar controller there as the green bar fills until you see a check or an "X" mark. If you see an "X," try again with the body of the guitar closer to the active speaker.,,,
help_text_calibration_8,To calibrate your system's video timing, when you are prompted, hold your Rock Band Wireless Fender Guitar Controller up to the center of your TV screen, with the guitar controller facing the TV and as close to the TV as possible without touching. This tends to work best in darker rooms, so either turn the lights down or angle the guitar slightly downwards away from the light. Hold your guitar controller there as the green bar fillsÂ until you see a check or an "X" mark. If you see an "X," try again with the body of the guitar closer to the screen, or a different angle.,,,
help_text_calibration_9,You should now be ideally calibrated! Test out a song in Quickplay to make sure it feels right. If not, try auto-calibrating again, or try calibrating manually.,,,

help_text_freestyle_guitar_solos_1,Freestyle Guitar Solos let you add your own creativity into the mix! Freestyle Guitar Solos are available for songs that support it, as indicated in the Music Library.,,,
help_text_freestyle_guitar_solos_10,Finally, if you'd rather just go wild without anyone telling you how to play, go to the Main Menu, select Modifiers from the Settings menu, and uncheck Guitar Solo Cues. You won't be scored for your Solo, but you can play whatever you want!,,,
help_text_freestyle_guitar_solos_2,To learn more, connect a guitar controller and then choose Training from the Main Menu. You'll see two freestyle guitar tutorials that will help you on your way.,,,
help_text_freestyle_guitar_solos_3,During guitar solo sections, there won't be any notes on the track. Instead, you'll see a series of patterns that tell you what you need to do to earn maximum points.,,,
help_text_freestyle_guitar_solos_4,If you see a long, solid line, that means to play a sustained note. Any fret is fine, just strum once and hold it!,,,
help_text_freestyle_guitar_solos_5,If you see a series of horizontal lines, try to strum at the same pace as they pass through the target. Sometimes they appear close together, that means you need to strum really fast!,,,
help_text_freestyle_guitar_solos_6,If you see little rectangles in groups of three, it's time for a tapping solo. Hold down one of the high fret buttons (the smaller ones closest to the body of the guitar), and then tap on the rest of the frets with both hands.,,,
help_text_freestyle_guitar_solos_7,If you see a long curve, you can play feedback. Play any note and then tilt the neck of the guitar up, as if you're going into Overdrive.,,,
help_text_freestyle_guitar_solos_8,If you see a multi-colored pattern, that means you can play anything! Go nuts.,,,
help_text_freestyle_guitar_solos_9,If the pattern is blue, you should play on the low fret buttons (the larger ones closest to the headstock).Â If the pattern is orange, you should play on the high fret buttons (the smaller ones closest to the body of the guitar).,,,

tour1a_results_screen,Right now, with {string:vocalist} on vocals, {string:drummer} on drums, {string:guitarist} on guitar, and {string:bassist} on bass, {string:band_name} is just another band out of {string:band_hometown}...,,,

tour1a_thresholdgig_postgig_2,But {string:vocalist}, the vocalist, gets a call from a guy named "Uncle Tony" who offers to manage the band. "You won't need that crappy van if you sign with Uncle Tony," he says, in the third person, annoyingly.\n\nChoosing a manager over the van could mean "serious moolah," but not as many new fans.,,300,
tour1a_thresholdgig_pretext,The band is dying to play out of town, and this show is the ticket.\n\nThe venue owner is going biodiesel and is offering the band his '87 Classic Conversion van as payment.,,270,

tour2a_preview,If you choose the van, you'll earn bonus fans! And because you're doing the DIY thing, you'll get more control over which songs you play. For <style=italic>most</style> shows, you'll get to select your own songs (from the Warmup and Apprentice tiers).,,,
tour2a_results_screen,You stayed true to your roots by getting a van... which promptly broke down and got broken into. Somehow, you still ended up better than you started, and with a bunch of new fans.,,,

tour2a_thresholdgig_postgig_2,On the other hand, an up-and-coming fashion blogger wants to join your entourage, but has no interest in crashing on your fans' "crusty rando couches." Going this route would get you a serious style update, but not as many fans as you'd get from couchsurfing.,,300,
tour2a_thresholdgig_pretext,In a totally unforeseeable incident, the van has been broken into and all of {string:band_name}'s gear has been stolen.\n\nThe venue owner takes pity on you and loans you some swank instruments.,,270,

btm_sub_mid_player_okay_guitar_5_010,The band would have been hard-pressed to find fault with the guitarist's strong performance. ,,,
btm_sub_mid_player_okay_vox_1_010,The crowd was pretty into the singer's decent performance.,,,

btm_sub_mid_player_okay_vox_5_010,There was nothing technically wrong with the singer's solid performance.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_bad_1_010,After a rocky start, it was uncertain whether the band could still win over the crowd.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_bad_2_010,After a rough start to the set, the band would really need to pull it together to make the show a success.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_bad_3_010,Things weren't looking great for the band, but the night was still young.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_bad_4_010,The band's confidence was shaken after a less than perfect start to the show. Could they still come out on top?,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_bad_5_010,Rattled by a rough start, the band would really need to focus to win back the love of the crowd.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_bad_fall_prm_show_1_010,Likely due to nerves, the band stumbled at the start of their big arena show. But could they recover and earn the crowd's affection?,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_bad_fall_prm_show_2_010,The band had not yet found their sea legs, but there was still plenty of time to turn the tide.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_bad_fall_prm_show_3_010,The band's first song didn't seem to appeal to Swami Ben's devoted followers, possibly because they were expecting their favorite anthem: "Swami Ben is the Golden Salvation" by Sister Denise.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_bad_fall_std_show_1_010,The band's first song went over worse than the newly enacted ban on nude fire dancing, but they still had time to win the crowd back.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_bad_fall_std_show_2_010,After a troublesome start, it seemed like the band might somehow lose money for the benefit.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_bad_fall_std_show_3_010,Perhaps reacting to the band's decidedly different image, the crowd was not yet won over.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_bad_finale_show_1_010,After a shaky start, the band tried to focus and regain their composure. Because seriously, it all came down to this one set.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_bad_red_prm_show_1_010,The band's set started off with a whimper, but that might have just been Fritzy trying to get a treaty bone.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_bad_red_prm_show_2_010,The crowd seemed displeased by the band's first song, possibly because they misunderstood it as a strongly worded treatise against bicycling.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_bad_red_prm_show_3_010,Though the band's set started out a bit rocky, the foreign crowd seemed to be in a forgiving mood.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_bad_red_std_show_1_010,Probably distracted by the hammer that Intense Carl was inexplicably waving around in the audience, the band's show got off to a rough start.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_bad_red_std_show_2_010,Even for what it was, the show wasn't going great, which is really saying something.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_bad_red_std_show_3_010,The band seemed off their game for the start of their set, possibly distracted by the animatronic pizza slice roller skating through the venue.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_bad_rise_show_1_010,Though they had played hard, the sole audience member called their performance "kind of butt.",,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_bad_rise_show_2_010,After a start that fourteen-year-old Cheyenne Resnick called "like, so gross," the band would need to work hard to turn things around.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_bad_rise_show_3_010,After a less than stellar start, Moosejaw Boudreau noted that the band was "still better than a case of the piles.",,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_good_1_010,The show was off to a tremendous start, but could the band keep up the momentum?,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_good_2_010,The crowd was primed and ready for more, but could the band deliver?,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_good_3_010,The band kicked off the show with a bang, but would it end with a whimper?,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_good_4_010,After a great start to the show, the band's big wager looked likely to pay out.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_good_5_010,The first song of the show got a huge response, but the band was only getting started.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_good_fall_prm_show_1_010,Despite their nerves, the band kicked off their big arena show with a monster performance.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_good_fall_prm_show_3_010,The band's first song was a hit with the crowd, if their lecherous hippie flailing was any indication.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_good_fall_std_show_1_010,The band's set started out hotter than the effigy burning just behind the stage. But could the band keep their cool?,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_good_fall_std_show_2_010,At the start of their set, the band's solid performance had the audience feeling even more charitable than usual.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_good_fall_std_show_3_010,Though it was unclear how the crowd felt about their unexpected image change, the band's set started off without a hitch.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_good_finale_show_1_010,With everything on the line, the band seemed primed to deliver the performance of a lifetime.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_good_red_prm_show_1_010,The crowd was loving the band's performance so far, though Fritzy the dog seemed uninspired.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_good_red_prm_show_2_010,Although they were in disguise, there was no disguising the band's ability. But could they keep the unfamiliar crowd on their side?,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_good_red_prm_show_3_010,The band played the first song of their set, and they did Overdrive and all that stuff, and it was really good.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_good_red_std_show_1_010,The set was going well. Even Intense Carl was cheerfully grinning...or possibly grimacing in a murderous rage. Hard to say.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_good_red_std_show_2_010,At the start of the band's set, the realtors were going wild, possibly because none of them had ever been to a cool rock concert before.,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_good_red_std_show_3_010,It was clear from the get-go that this show was a far cry from their last performance in the venue. But would the crowd stick around?,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_good_rise_show_1_010,The members, er, member, of the audience was impressed. But for how long?,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_good_rise_show_2_010,The band's first song was a hit, but would it be enough to beat ninth grader Junior Alvarez?,,,
btm_sub_mid_post_song_1_good_rise_show_3_010,After a strong start, the legendary Moosejaw Boudreau raved that the band was "medium.",,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_bad_1_010,The show so far had been something of a disaster, but it would all come down to the final song.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_bad_2_010,The band was close to striking out. But would the show end with a home run, or would it be the end of the ballgame?,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_bad_3_010,Nearing the end of their set, the band was in trouble, but they still had time to turn things around.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_bad_4_010,The crowd was losing patience with the band, but with one song left, could the band still win their hearts?,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_bad_5_010,Though the show hadn't exactly gone as planned, the band had one song left to earn the crowd's forgiveness and devotion.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_bad_fall_prm_show_1_010,Perhaps it was nerves from the packed crowd, or maybe they just ate too much pasta at lunch, but the band was in danger of tanking the show.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_bad_fall_prm_show_2_010,The band's performance so far had been sloppier than the sauce trough at the Ham Hut on deck nine, but the show wasn't over yet.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_bad_fall_prm_show_3_010,The show was not going super well so far. But then again, like, whatever, man, you know?,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_bad_fall_std_show_1_010,The band's performance was about to land right smack in the portable toilet. But could they still crawl out of the muck?,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_bad_fall_std_show_2_010,The band's charitable aims were admirable, but their seemingly constant mistakes were not.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_bad_fall_std_show_3_010,The band had only one chance to recover their image, however altered that image might be.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_bad_finale_show_1_010,With only one song left at their last show ever, could the band finally turn things around? I mean, jeez!,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_bad_red_prm_show_1_010,Though the band had one song left, Fritzy the dog gave up on them and went outside to "make tinkle" instead.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_bad_red_prm_show_2_010,Unimpressed so far, the audience members were calling the show an "unwieldy donkey parade," which was a pretty bad insult in their country.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_bad_red_prm_show_3_010,Look, things weren't perfect, but the singer's hair was looking very shiny. And isn't that what really matters in the end?,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_bad_red_std_show_1_010,It was unclear whether the band could turn the show around, what with Intense Carl pointedly stabbing his voodoo dolls in the front row.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_bad_red_std_show_2_010,Thanks to a lackluster set so far, the real estate agents were all, like, "Hey, let's get out of here and do some real estate stuff.",,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_bad_red_std_show_3_010,After a problematic set, it would all come down to the last song. And then, yes, after that, they could play pinball.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_bad_rise_show_1_010,Things didn't look good, but the one audience member in attendance thought the show "might get good, if the band would frickin' focus.",,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_bad_rise_show_2_010,The battle was all but lost, though Ashley L. and Ashley P. agreed that the guitarist was "kind of cute, in a weird way.",,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_bad_rise_show_3_010,The band's matinee performance had so far been their darkest hour, but could it still end in a good light?,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_good_1_010,The band had the crowd in the palm of their hands, but palms can sometimes be slippery.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_good_2_010,With most of the set behind them, the band just needed to put a cherry on their rock and roll sundae.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_good_3_010,The set had been a success so far, but the final performance would be make or break.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_good_4_010,The band had whipped up a storm of excitement, but with one song left, could the band bring the thunder?,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_good_5_010,The band had driven the crowd wild, but would the end of the set be the end of the road?,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_good_fall_prm_show_1_010,The crowd was in a frenzy, cheering and shrieking nonstop. I mean, honestly? It was kind of annoying.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_good_fall_prm_show_2_010,The band's performance was slaying the cruising crowd. It seemed like nothing could possibly go wrong.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_good_fall_std_show_1_010,The band had turned the crowd into a putrid froth of enthusiasm. But would their fervor last?,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_good_fall_std_show_2_010,The band was nailing their performance, and they looked even more attractive than usual, which is really saying something.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_good_fall_std_show_3_010,The band's set was killing, though the audience remained skeptical.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_good_finale_show_1_010,The band pretty much had the crowd in the palm of their hands, but for the sake of drama, let's say that they could still blow it.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_good_red_prm_show_1_010,Crowd members were heard exclaiming, "This is the best band I've ever seen at a dog's birthday party!",,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_good_red_prm_show_2_010,With one song left, it seemed like the band's cross-continent gamble might have paid off.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_good_red_prm_show_3_010,The band's fate would be determined by their final song. The awesome narrator sincerely hoped that they could pull it off.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_good_red_std_show_1_010,The show was such a success so far that the band hardly noticed that Intense Carl was surreptitiously licking their instrument cases.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_good_red_std_show_2_010,Things were going great amid the sea of responsible khakis and loafers that comprised the crowd.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_good_red_std_show_3_010,The show so far had been better than a free pitcher of Bonkazoid Berry Slush. It was up to the band to close out strong.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_good_rise_show_1_010,With their one fan whipped up into a sweaty, out-of-breath frenzy, the band was ready to take it home.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_good_rise_show_2_010,With one song left in their set, the band seemed poised for triumph, though their competition was decidedly stiff.,,,
btm_sub_mid_pre_last_song_good_rise_show_3_010,Even the hostile vets huddled near the snack table conceded the band's performance so far was a roaring success.,,,

help_text_my_stats_3,If you have the Rock Band Rivals expansion, you'll get some additional stats:,,,
help_text_my_stats_4,Skill measures how good you are at Rock Band. Each instrument has its own rating ranging from 0 to 1000. Every time you get a high score on a song, it contributes to that instrument's Skill. Perform well on higher instrument difficulties to increase it!,,,
help_text_my_stats_5,Level measures your amount of Rock Band experience. Every song you play earns you XP, and you can get bonus XP by participating in Challenges (see below). When you get enough XP, your level will increase.,,,

help_text_rivals_3,To get started with Rivals, select Career ? Rivals from the Main Menu. The first time you go here you'll be prompted to either join a Crew or create your own; after that you will see your Crew's profile screen.,,,
help_text_rivals_4,During each Challenge, there are two ways to help your Crew out. First, earn as much XP as you can by playing songs that fit the weekly theme. This might be a certain genre, or decade, or really anything, it changes from one Challenge to the next! Second, get the highest score you can on the three Spotlight Songs. You can jump right to the qualifying songs from the Crew profile screen, no need to back all the way out to the main menu!,,,
help_text_rivals_5,At the bottom left of the Crew profile screen is the Tier Status meter. This will show you your Crew's status during a Weekly Challenge. Your Crew's XP earnings and Spotlight songs are each given a number between 0 and 100, based on how you're doing compared to other Crews in your Tier. The number in the circle is the average of those two numbers.,,,
help_text_rivals_6,When the Challenge ends, this number will be converted to Rivals Points and awarded to your Crew. If you earn enough, you'll be promoted to the next Tier to face stiffer competition in the next challenge, but if you don't earn enough, you may drop down a Tier.,,,
help_text_rivals_7,Keep in mind that every Crew in your Tier is vying for a limited number of promotion slots. Just because you're sitting pretty at the beginning of a Challenge doesn't mean you can get complacent, you could be unseated at any moment!,,,
help_text_rivals_8,At the top right of the Crew profile screen is your Crew's Activity Feed. This will let you know everything important that's going on with your Crew, who's posting the high scores, who's getting all the XP, and how you did in the Challenge. If you press [[X]] on a message about someone's accomplishment, you can send them some congratulations (or gentle encouragement).,,,
help_text_rivals_9,At the bottom right of the Crew profile screen is your list of Badges. There are two kinds: Crew Badges and Individual Badges. You can earn Crew Badges by participating in Challenges, and earn Individual Badges by being a top performer in your Tier.,,,
help_text_rockudrama_header,Rockudrama,,,
help_text_rockudrama_1,Rockudrama is only available with the Rock Band Rivals expansion.,,,
help_text_rockudrama_2,Rockudrama is an all-new story mode. It's the first playable rock documentary, where you and your band group up, start gigging, and find your way through your very own story on a fictional TV show called Beneath the Tuneage. To get started, go to Career [[arrow]] Rockudrama from the Main Menu.,,,
help_text_rockudrama_3,Your band's Rockudrama story is broken up into multiple parts, and each part is made up of shows. When you play a show, the stars you earn are converted into Fame. Get more Fame by playing on higher difficulty levels!,,,
help_text_rockudrama_4,At the end of each part of the story, you have to have a certain amount of Fame in order to continue. If you don't have enough, you'll have to try that part again. If you get a ton of Fame, though, you can "go premium" on the next part. Premium parts have unique story paths and offer more Fame per show.,,,
help_text_rockudrama_5,On some shows you'll have the opportunity to bet on how many stars you think your band can earn. If you meet or exceed your wager, you'll get bonus Fame. You don't get anything extra for overshooting your bet, though, so choose wisely!,,,
help_text_rockudrama_6,Sometimes you'll also get other special opportunities for extra Fame, like additional challenges that change the rules of the game. Earn as much Fame as you can to get better Rock Shop rewards at the end of the story.,,,
