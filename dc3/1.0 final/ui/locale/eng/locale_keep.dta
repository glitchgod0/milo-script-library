   "Make sure you have enough space so you can move freely while playing. Gameplay with Kinect may require varying amounts of movement. Make sure you won't hit, run into, or trip over other players, bystanders, pets, furniture, or other objects when playing. If you stand or move during gameplay, you need good footing."
)
(about_kinect_2_body
   "Before playing: Look in all directions (right, left, forward, backward, down, and up) for things you might hit or trip over. Be sure your play area is far enough away from windows, walls, stairs, etc. Make sure there is nothing you might trip on - for example, toys, furniture, loose rugs, children, pets, etc. If necessary, move objects or people out of the play area. Don't forget to look up - be aware of light fixtures, fans, or other objects overhead when assessing the play area."

(about_kinect_3_body
   "While playing: Stay far enough away from the television to avoid contact. Keep enough distance from other players, bystanders, and pets - this distance may vary between games, so take account of how you are playing when determining how far away you need to be. Stay alert for objects or people you might hit or trip on - people or objects can move into the area during gameplay, so you should always be alert to your surroundings. Make sure you always have good footing while playing. Play on a level floor with enough traction for the game activities, and make sure you have appropriate footwear for gaming (no high heels, flip flops, etc.) or are barefoot if appropriate."

   "Before allowing children to use Kinect: Determine how each child can use Kinect and whether they should be supervised during these activities. If you allow children to use Kinect without supervision, be sure to explain all relevant safety and health information and instructions. Make sure children using Kinect play safely and within their limits, and make sure they understand proper use of the system."

   "To minimize eyestrain from glare: Position yourself at a comfortable distance from your monitor or television and the Kinect sensor; place your monitor or television and Kinect sensor away from light sources that produce glare, or use window blinds to control light levels; choose soothing natural light that minimizes glare and eyestrain and increases contrast and clarity; and adjust your monitor's or television's brightness and contrast."

(about_kinect_6_body
   "Don't overexert yourself. Gameplay with Kinect may require varying amounts of physical activity. Consult a doctor before using Kinect if you have any medical condition or issue that affects your ability to safely perform physical activities or if: You are or may be pregnant; you have heart, respiratory, back, joint, or other orthopedic conditions; you have high blood pressure or difficulty with physical exercise; or you have been instructed to restrict physical activity. Consult your doctor before beginning any exercise routine or fitness regimen that includes Kinect. Do not play under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and make sure your balance and physical abilities are sufficient for any movements while gaming. Stop and rest if your muscles, joints, or eyes become tired or sore. If you experience excessive fatigue, nausea, shortness of breath, chest tightness, dizziness, discomfort, or pain, STOP USING IMMEDIATELY, and consult a doctor.
